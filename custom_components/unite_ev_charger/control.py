"""Pure charging-control logic for the Unite EV Charger.

Everything here is deliberately free of Home Assistant and hardware: given
numbers in, it returns the target charge current. That makes the decision logic
fully unit-testable without a charger - exactly where the old integration was
guesswork. State (smoothing, dwell timers, last setpoint) lives in the
HA-aware controller; this module only does the math.
