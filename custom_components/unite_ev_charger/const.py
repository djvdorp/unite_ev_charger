# Phase switching is a single register-405 write in every case (plug-in or

# --- Optional adaptive 1->3 phase recovery ----------------------------------
# Some cars (verified on real hardware) cache their 1p/3p choice per session and
# refuse a live 1->3 upshift while charging - neither a plain 405 write nor evcc
# can force it. The only thing that works is a long charging pause: the car must
# sit at 0 A / IEC status B long enough (measured: >61 s, 91 s worked) to
# re-negotiate. Opt-in, off by default, because it deliberately interrupts
# charging. When on: first try the normal live switch and observe; only if the
# car is still physically single-phase do we force the pause. We do NOT write
# 405 again after the pause - the register is already 3P; only the pause matters.

# --- DLB input health -------------------------------------------------------
# DLB exists to protect the main fuse, so it must fail closed: a grid-current

# trusted. Generous enough not to trip on sensors that only publish on change,
# tight enough to catch a dead one.

# How the wallbox is physically wired. Register 404 alone cannot tell a genuine

# phase-config restore is gated on this explicit setting. Defaults to what the
# charger reports at setup; the user can correct it.
# Automatically re-apply the installation phase config after every unplug - the
# firmware only restores register 405 to its default on a power cycle, reset or
# Modbus disconnect (never on unplug), so on some chargers a session can start
# on one phase even though 3-phase is configured. Toggling currentLimiterPhase
# forces the firmware to re-apply its default. Opt-in: it writes an installation
# setting over the charger's web UI. Edge-triggered (once per unplug), so no
# retry/pacing machinery is needed - a failed attempt is simply retried at the
# next unplug. Guarded by CONF_GRID_PHASES so a genuine 1-phase install is never
# forced to 3-phase.
